ðŸ‘‹ **Hello!** Iâ€™m Aisha 

I've just completed a 13-week software development bootcamp with 'Northcoders' which covered a bunch of things! Including..
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase
- Frontend: User accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS, React, React Native
- Other: TDD, pair programming, agile methodoligies 

Iâ€™m interested in travelling, hiking, reading (and coding of course!)
âš¡ Fun fact: I did a 4 day hike to Machu Picchu and ran a hal-marathon in Morocco for charity!
